# üìå Productivity App - Cerebliss

## Description

Cerebliss is a task-focused time management app designed to help users stay productive and organized by breaking their day down into small chunks of work. Each task includes a countdown timer to allow the user to stay engaged. The app includes flexibility, allowing users to adjust schedules, take breaks, and extend task durations as needed. Additionally, game-type features such as streaks and progress charts would make the productivity feel rewarding.

## Current Status

**Work in Progress**
This project is currently under development. I'm actively working on improving and exapanding it. As a result, some functionalities are incomplete.

## Technologies used

-   JavaScript, React Native
-   Quote API

## Key Features

The key features and the core functionalities are described below:

1.  **Scheduling Feature:** Create a full study schedule for the day or the week, including specific times and durations for each task.
2.  **Countdown Timer:** Customizable countdown timer that is associated with each task, which could be extended as needed.
3.  **Break Feature:** A pause and resume function that can be used while completing a task or after finishing one.
4.  **Notification Feature:** Sends notification a few minutes before the next task starts, when a break ends, or when the daily goal is reached.
5.  **Visualization Chart:** Visual representation of the productivity. Shows the percentage of completed tasks compared to the initially scheduled tasks for the day.
6.  **Streak Feature:** Tracks productivity streaks throughout the week when the user remains consistently productive. A streak is lost if the percentage of completed tasks falls below a certain percentage.
7.  **Music Player:** Using the Spotify API, users can connect to their account and play songs within the application. Displays the song title, artist name, a basic control features, such as pause, play, and skip.
