# 📌 Productivity App - Cerebliss

## 📒 Description

Cerebliss is a task-focused time management app designed to help users stay productive and organized by breaking their day down into small chunks of work. Each task includes a countdown timer to allow the user to stay engaged. The app includes flexibility, allowing users to adjust schedules, take breaks, and extend task durations as needed. Additionally, game-type features such as streaks and progress charts would make the productivity feel rewarding.
